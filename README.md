## What it does

Unity-Localization-Inspector is an addon for [Unity-Localization-Core](https://www.github.com/VRLabs/Unity-Localization-Core) that allows for a convenient UI for translating values.

## Features

- Compare with a language of your choice
- Tooltips in a dropdown
- Popup for ease-of-use

## How to use

- Ensure the Assembly Definition containing the class you want to translate is pointing to the VRLabs install of Unity-Localization-Core, not some custom one.
- Click on a Localization File, and the nice UI should show itself.

## License

Unity-Localization-Inspector is available as-is under MIT. For more information see [LICENSE](https://github.com/VRLabs/Unity-Localization-Inspector/blob/main/LICENSE).
